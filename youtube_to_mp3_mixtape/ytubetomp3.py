            ##### YOUTUBE TO MP3 SPLITTER  ######
            #####################################
ABOUT:
Have you ever found a good music compilation on youtube and wanted to download a playlist but you
didn't have time to mess around with splitting music into separate songs and do the boring ID3 editing in Audacity?
This script might help you. You just need a youtube link and a tracklist of the songs with their timestamps
(usually already in description or in top comments). Read the comments below for detailed instructions!
PYTHON REQUIREMENTS:
Python 3, pydub and youtube_dl
The script wil try to autoinstall missing dependecies, so if using in virtualenv, remove autoinstalling part or make sure
you already have pydub and youtube_dl installed!
USAGE:
The script itself is already a working example for downloading and splitting a Proleter video, so just modify it
according to your favourite Youtube music compilation. Just edit a SAVE_FOLDER to match your PC and create a textfile called
Proleter.txt next to this script with the following content (found under the Youtube video)
Proleter.txt
0:00:00 - My Melancholy Baby
0:03:58 - Can't Stop Me
0:07:42 - Fat Morris
0:11:32 - Sometimes
0:13:07 - Red Soap
0:16:23 - April Showers
0:20:52 - By The Rivers
0:24:33 - It Don't Mean A Thing
0:28:12 - Queen of Hearts
0:32:09 - U Can Get It
0:36:30 - Not Afraid
0:39:47 - Throw It Back (Instrumental)
0:42:48 - Downtown Irony
0:47:21 - Faidherbe Square
0:50:50 - Muhammad Ali
DISCLAIMER:
This is just a proof of concept. Use at your own risk! Songs might be cut unproperly if provided timestamps don't match
the actual songs in the video! Tested on Linux only.

# You have to change the separator and the order of INFO list to match the original list. Be consistent!
# You might need some text file editing to match given criteria!
# INFO variable must have 2 or 3 elements. Adjust ordering of elements to match the file contents.
# TIME and TITLE are neccessary, ARTIST is optional, if downloading compilation! If not in the file, specifiy artist
# separately
